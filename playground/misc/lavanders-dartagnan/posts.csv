       D’Artagnan, the iconic figure of swashbuckling adventure novels, was not a mere invention—he truly existed. Alexandre Dumas based his famous character on the writings of a 17th-century author, Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras. In 1700, Courtilz published the

       From the beginning of his personal reign, Louis XIV pursued a grand political vision involving wars of conquest. He sought glory on the battlefield and to assert France’s power over its European neighbors.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       After an initial campaign in the winter of 1665, the King launched his first war: the War of Devolution. Though his swift victories in the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comté must have  pleased him, Louis XIV sought a more spectacular war. Thus, with patience and care he and his ministers prepared the Franco-Dutch War over four years. Their enemy was identified: the Protestant and commercially powerful Dutch Republic.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In 1672 the French army, commanded by Turenne and Condé and accompanied by Louis XIV himself, invaded the Dutch Republic. The Rhine was crossed and Dutch cities fell rapidly and with little resistance. The goal was Amsterdam, but the Dutch flooded the countryside by breaking the dykes. Despite a musketeer attempt to prevent this, land access was cut off, thereby halting the campaign. Louis XIV returned to France, acknowledging the setback.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       For the 1673 campaign the King focused on the most formidable fortress in Europe, avoided the previous year: Maastricht. Vauban was charged with conducting the sieg and applying his expertise. Louis XIV arrived at the city on June 10, whereupon work began immediately on establishing a large defensive perimeter. Once this was done the besiegers began to dig  approach trenches on the night of June 17-18. To avoid direct fire the trenches zigzagged, reaching 30 meters from the outer fortifications of the Tongres Gate by June 24.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The first attack took place on the night of June 24-25, led by musketeers commanded in part by d’Artagnan, then

       of the day, along with grenadiers targeting the advanced demi-lune. Fierce fighting ensued, with strong Dutch resistance, yet between 4 and 5 a.m. the musketeers secured the position, where they were relieved between 6 and 7 a.m. by the French Guards.

   <div>
    <div>
     <p>
      <span>
       On Sunday 25 June 1673 the weather was hot and heavy. Around noon the Dutch launched a counterattack. Surprised, the French Guards began to retreat. From his camp d’Artagnan heard a gunshot and, to prevent the loss of the demi-lune, rushed back into combat. The 24-year-old Duke of Monmouth, illegitimate son of King Charles II of England, led a small detachment of English soldiers attached to the French army as lieutenant of the day. Inexperienced, Monmouth charged openly under enemy fire, ignoring d’Artagnan’s advice to use the less exposed trench. He charged directly at a barricade built that morning by the French.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Honorable as ever, d’Artagnan followed, crossing the barricade through a narrow passage where he was struck in the head by a musket ball.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       With Monmouth, the musketeers renewed their assault, pushed back the Dutch, and secured control of the demi-lune despite heavy losses. After another French assault on the night of June 27-28, led by the second company of musketeers, the Dutch surrendered on June 30.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Several musketeers tried to recover d’Artagnan’s body under fire; four died before Saint-Léger, the company’s

       , succeeded. Louis XIV rewarded him with 30,000 livres. The King held a mass in d’Artagnan’s memory; his body was watched over by his two cousins and buried in an unknown location.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       D’Artagnan was mourned by both his men and by the King. Pelisson, the King’s historian, wrote: “One cannot express how deeply he was regretted by everyone, especially the King, who spoke of him many times with great esteem and sorrow.” Pierre Quarré d’Aligny, wounded during the demi-lune assault, wrote: “If one could die of grief, I truly would be dead. Had we not laboured at that cursed barrier, he would still be alive.”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       D’Artagnan’s death marked the beginning of an unparalleled legend, crossing time and borders. His name, synonymous with panache and bravery, remains an enduring inspiration.

       The marriage of Louis XIV, celebrated in 1660, was a major event for the French monarchy. The 22-year-old King married Marie-Thérèse of Austria, Infanta of Spain, thereby sealing peace between the two European powers after years of conflict.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The union aimed to ease the rivalry between the Spanish Habsburgs and the French Bourbons and also to strengthen the young monarch’s legitimacy at a time when he was still seeking to assert his authority following the turbulent period of the Fronde.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In this environment of diplomatic negotiations and military tension d’Artagnan played a discreet yet important role. Entrusted with sensitive missions to ensure the security of the royal event, he was a trusted man first of Cardinal Mazarin and later of Louis XIV himself. He supervised the protection of the routes used by the court and ensured the safety of those traveling to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, the wedding’s location.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       His unwavering loyalty and military efficiency helped maintain calm during the critical days surrounding the signing and celebration of the treaty. His presence reassured the government in circumstances where any attempt at assassination or sabotage could have jeopardized the fragile peace between France and Spain.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Louis XIV developed an absolute monarchy based on divine right. He centralized the kingdom’s administration, strengthened royal authority over the French Church and staged his power through court etiquette and grandeur, especially at Versailles which he transformed into a permanent royal residence. The palace became the political and cultural heart of France.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Under his reign France experienced a golden age of the arts and the intellect which saw Molière, Racine, Lully, Le Brun and the founding of the Royal Academy of Sciences.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Militarily, Louis XIV waged several wars aimed at expanding France’s borders or defending dynastic interests. However, although sometimes victorious, these conflicts ultimately weakened the country.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       His reign also included controversial decisions such as the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, which led to the exile of many Protestants and harmed the economy.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Louis XIV died on 1 September 1715 at the age of 76, leaving behind a powerful, centralized kingdom but one that was impoverished and exhausted by war.

       Originally, the King’s Musketeers were just one corps of the royal guard, tasked with the King’s close protection, though on a few occasions Louis XIII ordered them to fight on the front lines, such as at the Battle of the Pas de Suse in 1629. It was Louis XIV who assigned them an active combat role in 1665, and from then onwards they took part in all the military campaigns of his reign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The very nature of mounted musketeers revealed their combat versatility, and as mounted infantry they fought both on foot and on horseback, foreshadowing the future dragoons. This tactical flexibility, combined with high mobility, made the King’s Musketeers in the 17th century more like elite commando units than regular troops. In battle formations musketeers were placed on the flanks or outside the lines, ready to be deployed wherever needed. They were a highly mobile shock troop.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Musketeers fought in pitched battles, sieges and “commando” operations. Their role in line battles grew particularly in the 18th century when they were integrated into heavy cavalry. But under Louis XIII and Louis XIV they often led cavalry charges, fought on foot or covered army retreats, such as during the siege of Candia in 1669. Their greatest usefulness was in sieges, where they were deployed to defend besieged cities, counter sallies by defenders or, most importantly, to lead assaults.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The year 1677 alone demonstrated their particular versatility when, to Louis XIV’s astonishment, they stormed the city of Valenciennes in under an hour, an achievement that remains their most brilliant feat. A month later they charged both on foot and on horseback at the Battle of Cassel. And finally, detached from the main army, they supported a siege led by William of Orange at Charleroi.

       Louis XIII, nicknamed the “Warrior King”, embodied the will to foster territorial expansion and to strengthen royal sovereignty, supported by his chief minister Cardinal Richelieu. Like his father Henri IV he actively commanded military campaigns during his 33-year reign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       From a young age, Louis XIII showed a strong interest in military affairs, influenced by his passion for hunting and artillery. Trained as a cavalryman he participated actively in battles, notably during internal wars against Protestants, revolts by the peasantry and noble conspiracies by the nobility.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Louis XIII led several important campaigns, including the repression of Huguenot uprisings, war against the House of Habsburg and sieges of La Rochelle and Montauban. In 1629 he secured the Peace of Alès, which ended religious wars in France. Other military campaigns continued in Italy and against Protestants in the south. The war against the Habsburgs escalated into direct confrontation, especially in 1635 with successes in Picardy and the defense of Paris against Spanish troops. Louis XIII’s army was known for mobilizing large forces and fighting on multiple fronts.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       He died in May 1643 after having reinforced France’s image as a European military power. His final decisive victory at Rocroi against the Spanish marked a turning point in the Thirty Years’ War. Thanks to his military successes France consolidated its power and weakened the threat from the Habsburgs.

       Although we feel we know d’Artagnan’s face, no known or historically verified portrait of the Musketeer exists. An inventory made after the death of his brother-in-law mentions a portrait that has since been lost.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Charles de Batz was not a prominent public figure like a King or a great noble, making it unlikely that an official portrait was commissioned or circulated at court. In the 17th century only members of the high nobility and  clergy or notable intellectual and artistic figures were regularly painted. D’Artagnan, belonging to a lesser Gascon nobility, would not have prioritized such an expensive luxury.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       It was Courtilz de Sandras and later Dumas who popularized the character. Their literary success came after d’Artagnan’s death, at a time when no one had thought to preserve or celebrate his image. The strong association between the fictional character and the historical man has further blurred the lines between fact and fiction.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Moreover, the absence of a known burial site for his body adds to the romantic and legendary aura surrounding the Musketeer.

       The musket was the Musketeer’s standard weapon and it gave the corps its name. Under the Ancien Régime it was common to name military units after their primary arms. Thus the

       when Louis XIII rearmed them with muskets in 1622.
      </span>
     </p>

      <span>
       This early matchlock musket weighed 6 to 8 kilograms and required many accessories to load. It was slow to reload, inaccurate and needed a

       —a wooden support planted in the ground to stabilize the shot. In other words Musketeers had to dismount to fire; it was an infantry weapon. By the late 17th century the Musketeers had replaced their matchlocks with flintlock rifles. By then, however, the name had stuck; they had already built a reputation that the King wished to preserve.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Yet Musketeers are most often pictured with sword in hand. Among the nobility—which made up the overwhelming majority of their ranks—firearms were seen as cowardly, being weapons that could be used from a distance. Upholding chivalric values, Musketeers preferred close combat, often discarding their muskets to charge under enemy fire. Numerous types of sword  were used, especially for court or for duels.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>

       As cavalrymen, Musketeers also carried a pair of pistols stored in holsters on their saddles.

       He made his first appearance at court during the royal wedding in Saint-Jean-de-Luz in 1660, at the age of fourteen. Encouraged by his father to pursue a military career, he entered the Royal Academy of Juilly before becoming a page at the

       He later joined the Musketeers in the same company as his illustrious cousin, serving for over twenty years. Under d’Artagnan’s command he was assigned in 1665 to the fortress of Pinerolo, where Nicolas Fouquet was imprisoned.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       From 1667 to 1713 he took part in many battles under Louis XIV. Appointed

      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Wounded in action he was made Marshal of France by royal decree on 30 September 1709. Upon his father’s death he inherited the title of Count of Montesquiou, but was known at court as Marshal d’Artagnan. He served as governor of Brittany from 1716 to 1720 and was appointed to the Regency Council on 16 June 1721.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       During his long career, he participated in 18 battles and 21 sieges, 12 of them as commander-in-chief. Appointed Inspector General of the Infantry by Louvois, he helped implement significant reforms of this military branch during the second half of Louis XIV’s reign.

       In 1714, following the death of their father, Marshal Pierre de Montesquiou became guardian to d’Artagnan’s two grandsons. He died at his château in Plessis-Robinson on August 12, 1725.

       Raised by his mother following the death of his father.  Around 1666, at about fifteen years of age, Joseph left his native Gascony to live in Paris with his famous cousin Charles de Batz, who became responsible for his education and military training.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Thanks to this patronage Joseph was enrolled in a military academy. Though he quickly became a skilled horseman, his taste for the pleasures offered by Paris plunged him into debt. Constantly seeking help from his family, he racked up creditors and financial obligations. Nonetheless, he joined the Musketeers in 1668, continuing his lavish lifestyle while pleading for financial support. His repeated requests for money illustrate the high costs of military service and the strict fashion standards that were expected at court.
      </span>

       Despite these difficulties and with his family’s help, Joseph eventually stabilized his career, being promoted to

       Like his cousin Pierre, Joseph was at d’Artagnan’s side during the Siege of Maastricht in 1673 when the latter was killed in action. Made a Knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit in 1724, Joseph retired to his château at Maupertuis, where he died on 4 January 1729.

       The popularity of d’Artagnan far outshines that of his three friends (only a handful of works focus on Athos, Porthos or Aramis) but they should not be overlooked. In fact, while Dumas’ hero has enjoyed a legacy far surpassing that of other famous swashbuckling novel characters like Pardaillan or Lagardère, it is most likely thanks to his companions. The h’ friendship — which endures despite differences in personality, conflicting interests and even the passage of time — lies at the very core of the musketeers’ myth. If nowhere else, one need only look at the enduring popularity of their motto, “All for one, one for all.” Although Dumas uses this phrase only once in his novel, it has come to symbolize the bond between the four men. Countless books bear this phrase as their title, and comic books often depict the musketeers crossing swords, the visual equivalent of the famous motto.

       Four Musketeers rode ahead of the royal coach, muskets loaded, while the rest of the squadron cleared the road.

       Each year the King inspected his Musketeers in person at Versailles, where the companies arrived several days in advance and were housed in private mansions. This highly codified event, which served to showcase their discipline and precision, unfolded in three phases:

       From 1622 onward the Musketeers were quartered in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, lodged in the homes of residents who were obliged to host these boisterous young soldiers. In 1659 Louis XIV decided to build them a proper barracks on the

     <p>
      <span>
       Designed to house 150 men, the complex included accommodations, stables and various services such as a chapel, a forge and a bakery. However, as the King began favoring Saint-Germain-en-Laye and later Versailles, and as most troops were mobilized outside the capital during military campaigns, the Musketeers’ presence in Paris became less essential.

       Musketeers usually entered the corps at a young age—around sixteen—and a strong recommendation was extremely helpful. Continuing a long tradition, a Gascon or Béarnais background remained an advantage. As mentioned above, the King held the formal title of Captain and took a personal interest in the company’s affairs.

       After their initial training, which could last up to two years, young Musketeers would often apply to purchase a commission as an officer in a regular army regiment. This Musketeer training was highly respected: by the 18th century, one out of every two Marshals of France had started their career in

       </span>

       . Reserved for the elite, these schools taught horsemanship, fencing, dancing and various other disciplines (music, history, politics, mathematics and

       , or the art of siege warfare). They attracted prominent names from across Europe, including the Duke of Buckingham in 1611.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Among these institutions, the Academy founded by Antoine de Pluvinel in Paris was the most prestigious in the early 17th century. A close confidant of King Henry IV, Pluvinel was responsible for young Louis XIII’s equestrian training. He had studied in Italy under Pignatelli—the greatest riding master in Europe—and adopted more humane methods toward horses. His Academy also served as a social space, welcoming future military officers such as the young Richelieu.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       By the 17th century, however, this style of equestrian training was increasingly criticized as being disconnected from the reality of the battlefield, and the first true military riding school, focused on more practical training, was created in 1744 specifically to address this issue.

       Dance was considered essential, as it taught posture and self-control. One surviving booklet even attests to a ballet composed specifically for the Musketeer company. Furthermore, Pierre de Montesquiou d’Artagnan—cousin of the famous captain-lieutenant—took part in the grand opening procession of

      The Transformation from Historical Figure to Mythical Character

   <div>
    <div>
     <p>
      <span>
       Unlike other units of the King’s guard the Musketeers and d’Artagnan have left an indelible mark on French culture, where they have transcended their original political and military roles to become mythical heroes of literature and cinema. This transformation was based largely on historical elements that Alexandre Dumas and Auguste Maquet skillfully dramatized in their novels.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The chivalric values upheld on the battlefield by the Musketeers during their lifetime contributed greatly to their reputation as formidable soldiers. This ideal of chivalry—characterized by fearlessness in the face of death, a quest for personal glory and combat with sword in hand—explains why many young gentlemen were eager to join their ranks, where the Musketeers were seen as guardians of noble military traditions.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       D’Artagnan was originally just one Musketeer among many, but he distinguished himself by his loyalty to Louis XIV. These noble values gradually spread and became democratized with the revolutionary ideals, eventually coming to define the French spirit itself—blending bravery, camaraderie, esprit de corps and service to the state. When the Musketeers were reestablished in 1814 young men from all social classes rushed to join. In a society shaped by romanticism and nostalgia, they all dreamed of living the exploits of these French knights. The Musketeers were already stepping into legend.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Though definitively disbanded in 1815, the Musketeers continued to symbolize a glorious chapter of France’s past, especially within the emerging national narrative orchestrated by Louis-Philippe. At his Musée de l’Histoire de France in Versailles, the Musketeers visually represented French victories at Valenciennes and Fontenoy. When Dumas and Maquet published
      </span>
      <i>
       <span>
        The Three Musketeers
       </span>
      </i>
      <span>
       in 1844, the “real” Musketeers were no longer unknown figures, but the novelists still had to find a hero. It was then that the values embodied by the Musketeers were crystallized and personified in a fictional d’Artagnan, greatly inspired by the real d’Artagnan and other historical figures of his era.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In 1844 the Musketeers entered fully the realm of legend. Many decades later it would be the cinema that would play a major role in immortalizing them. The chivalric values they represented, visually symbolized by their distinctive uniform, lie at the heart of the literary myth’s success—one that remains deeply rooted in historical fact.

       In 1667 d’Artagnan was ennobled as the Count of d’Artagnan. His social rise provoked jealousy and accusations of usurpation, as the title technically belonged to his cousin Joseph de Montesquiou. Nevertheless, the monarchy turned a blind eye to this irregularity, allowing d’Artagnan to secure his place in high society.

       . Though demolished in 1881, a detailed notarial inventory has preserved its description.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Behind a large carriage entrance, the courtyard—decorated with Dutch porcelain vases—could accommodate two richly adorned coaches. On the ground floor were the kitchen and pantry, where his maid Fiacrine Pinon lived. D’Artagnan, frequently away, rarely dined there.
      </span>
      <span>
       <br/>
      </span>
      <span>
       On the first floor, an antechamber opened onto a luxurious bedroom with a view over the Seine. Furnished with a high walnut canopy bed and wall tapestries, the room also featured a wardrobe. From the window, one could see the Louvre, the Pont Rouge and the Pont Neuf.
      </span>
      <span>
       <br/>
      </span>
      <span>
       The second floor mirrored the first: an antechamber, a richly decorated bedroom with Flemish tapestries, fine wooden furniture and a grand bed draped in brocatelle. A nearby boudoir, adorned with tapestries and engravings, held a portrait of Cardinal Mazarin— a memento from d’Artagnan’s early career.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The third floor was less refined, with a large room, attic and garret. A wine cellar—empty at the time of the inventory—must once have held fine wines, managed by his personal sommelier.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The home’s elegance extended to d’Artagnan’s wardrobe: rich fabrics, brocade, velvet and refined accessories that reflected both his status and his impeccable style. The house’s panoramic view of the Seine was a rare luxury in a city where most homes were dark and unsanitary.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Yet d’Artagnan was not a man of domestic life. Above all he was a soldier—rarely home, always on duty for the King. His rise to power reflects the ambition and determination of a young Gascon cadet who climbed to the highest echelons of the monarchy.

       revolves around a love triangle that may have been more fact than fiction: King Louis XIII, his wife Anne of Austria and the Duke of Buckingham—all under the watchful eye of Cardinal Richelieu. Though officially a guardian of the King’s honour and state affairs, Richelieu may also have harboured personal feelings for the Queen, pursuing the affair with both jealousy and political precision.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The affair began in May 1625 when Buckingham arrived in France to escort Henrietta Maria, newly married to England’s King Charles I. His flamboyant charm and lavish style dazzled the French court and captivated Queen Anne. Their chemistry quickly became the subject of court gossip, and both Louis XIII and Richelieu were impatient for Buckingham’s departure. Despite the efforts of Marie de’ Medici to avoid scandal, Anne and Buckingham managed to meet in secret in the gardens of the archbishop’s palace in Amiens. The duke’s advances became so insistent that the Queen had to call her ladies-in-waiting for help.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       This scandal outraged the King. According to the Duke of La Rochefoucauld, Anne later gifted Buckingham the diamond studs she had worn at their first meeting. The Countess of Lanoy, one of the Queen’s ladies-in-waiting, allegedly reported the incident to Richelieu, who saw it as proof of the Queen’s indiscretion.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       This episode directly inspired Dumas, who made the diamond studs a central plot device in his novel, weaving together espionage, passion and political intrigue in true swashbuckling style.

       In the novel, Dumas pauses the action to describe in detail a ballet performed for King Louis XIII by the aldermen of Paris. Queen Anne dances while wearing the fateful studs, symbolizing her triumph thanks to d’Artagnan’s success in outwitting Richelieu’s schemes.

       In 1672, on the eve of the Dutch War, the governor of Lille, Marshal d’Humières, refused to obey Marshal de Turenne, whom Louis XIV had just appointed captain general of the French armies, and was forced into exile. Lille was a key fortress in Vauban’s defensive “pré carré” system, acting as the northern border’s strategic lock. Given its importance, Louis XIV replaced d’Humières with a trusted man: d’Artagnan, his loyal lieutenant captain of the Mousquetaires, who was appointed interim governor of Lille from April to October 1672.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       This episode is the best-known of d’Artagnan’s life and reveals his uncompromising and sometimes irritable character. He maintained extensive correspondence with Louvois, the War Minister, and managed to offend nearly everyone locally, especially Vauban’s men.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Captured in 1667, Lille was quickly transformed into a formidable fortress with strong bastioned walls and what Vauban called the “queen of citadels.” Vauban, as governor of the citadel (theoretically under the city governor’s authority), supervised the work remotely, delegating construction of the fortress wall to engineer Montgivrault and the citadel’s command to La Vercantière.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       As governor d’Artagnan oversaw the wall’s construction. However, believing that Montgivrault disregarded his orders and showed insufficient deference, the Mousquetaire reacted strongly, calling Montgivrault a “two-day engineer,” threatening to “throw him off the rampart” and declaring “I would surely break his head”, maintaining in his hot-headed and  argumentative manner that disrespect towards him was tantamount to disrespect towards the King. Vauban had to leave the front to reason with d’Artagnan, but in this he failed. As he was later to write, “You know how stubborn and unbending Mr. d’Artagnan can be!”
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The fact is that d’Artagnan disliked the post and accepted it solely because the order came from the King. Instead, he longed to return to his Mousquetaires and to fight in the Dutch War that was just beginning. Louvois urged patience, however, and by the year’s end he was recalled. After waiting out the winter, d’Artagnan finally took part in the 1673 campaign.

       During the early reign of Louis XIV Nicolas Fouquet, Superintendent of Finances, enjoyed immense prestige by virtue of his wealth and influence. Confident that his lavish displays — such as the grand festivities at the Château de Vaux — would earn him royal favour, he instead aroused the suspicion of the King, who saw him as a dangerously powerful subject. Fouquet’s rival, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, fueled this mistrust and persuaded the King to have Fouquet arrested. This arrest, entrusted to d’Artagnan, became a symbol of the consolidated royal power.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       As the court traveled to Nantes to convene the Estates of Brittany, Fouquet ignored warnings from his allies advising him to flee. Secrecy was paramount because of Fouquet’s power and extensive court connections, and any sympathy for him had to be avoided. D’Artagnan was informed only shortly beforehand.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       On the morning of 5 September d’Artagnan led a hundred Musketeers waiting in the courtyard of the Château de Nantes. To mislead observers, the King announced he would go hunting immediately after the council meeting. Fouquet presented himself to the King and, after the session ended, left the royal residence. D’Artagnan thereupon pursued and arrested him on the cathedral square, causing great surprise at court. The Musketeers escorted the disgraced minister to the Château d’Angers, where he was imprisoned for three months. D’Artagnan was ordered to keep watch over Fouquet and to sleep in his cell.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       From there, after a stop at the Château d’Amboise, Fouquet was escorted to the Château de Vincennes, where he stayed on the first floor of the keep from 1662 to 1663. On 19 June 1663, in order for him to be closer to his place of his trial, Fouquet was transferred under d’Artagnan’s guard to the Bastille.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Although Fouquet undoubtedly abused his position by mixing private interests with royal finances, he was pursued relentlessly by Colbert and his accusers, using selected documents and biased investigators.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       At the conclusion of the hearings on 22 December 1664 the Court of Justice sentenced Fouquet to exile, but the displeased King converted this sentence to life imprisonment.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Fouquet was then sent to Pignerol, and it was d’Artagnan’s responsibility to escort him there in the middle of winter and hand him over to his jailer, Saint-Mars — also a Musketeer — on 16 January 1665. Fouquet never left his prison and died there in 1680.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       D’Artagnan carried out this duty with rigour and discretion, earning the respect of Fouquet and his associates. Madame de Sévigné, in her letters, even praised d’Artagnan’s humanity and kindness toward the former minister.

       Nicolas Fouquet, Marquis of Belle-Île, Viscount of Melun and Vaux, came from a wealthy family of parliamentarians. He was intelligent, daring and loyal to the monarchy, which facilitated his rapid social rise.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       His loyalty to Cardinal Mazarin during the Fronde earned him a significant promotion, and in 1653 he was appointed Superintendent of Finances. Fouquet played a key role in managing France’s finances, notably by funding wars and strengthening royal power.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       He commissioned the construction of the sumptuous Château de Vaux, calling upon the talents of architect Louis Le Vau, painter Charles Le Brun and landscaper André Le Nôtre. This estate became a symbol of his wealth and his passion for the arts.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       On 17 August 1661 Fouquet hosted an extravagant fête at Vaux in honour of Louis XIV, but this display of grandeur was perceived by the young King as a threat to his authority. Arrested by d’Artagnan and the King’s Musketeers, Fouquet was accused of embezzlement and lèse-majesté.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       He was tried in a lengthy three-year trial, and in 1664 he was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was incarcerated at the fortress of Pignerol, where he died on 23 March 1680.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Despite his downfall Nicolas Fouquet left a significant cultural legacy. His patronage contributed greatly to the flourishing of the arts in France, and the Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte remains a testament to classical French architecture and landscape design.

       Dumas draws on Voltaire’s theory that the prisoner was a brother of Louis XIV, held in the Bastille to prevent any challenge to the throne. In the novel, the prisoner is freed by Aramis and attempts to switch places with Louis XIV during the festivities organized by Fouquet at Vaux. Thanks to Fouquet’s loyalty and d’Artagnan’s vigilance, however, the plot is foiled. The King, to eliminate any further threat, sentences his rival to lifelong imprisonment wearing an iron mask to conceal his identity.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Many hypotheses have been suggested regarding the prisoner’s identity: Fouquet or one of his servants, the Count of Vermandois, the Duke of Beaufort, a Jacobite spy, or even Molière or d’Artagnan himself.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The prisoner, always guarded by Saint-Mars, was transferred from Pignerol to the Bastille in 1698, still masked. He died there in 1703 under the name Marchioli.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       As for the actual iron masks preserved at the Army Museum, it remains uncertain whether they were used as fencing protection, armor components or pillory accessories. The mystery endures, fueling legends and speculation.

       Born around 1620, Henry d’Aramitz took his name from a domain in the Barétous valley of Béarn (also the birthplace of the Portau family). He came from a military nobility; his grandfather Pierre d’Aramitz—a Huguenot who distinguished himself during the Wars of Religion—had three children. Among them, his daughter Marie married Jean du Peyrer, mother of the future Count of Tréville, and his son Charles married Catherine d’Espalungue and was Henry’s father.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Little is known about Henry’s military career, except that he reportedly served fifteen years in the King’s troops. He remained with the Musketeers until their dissolution in 1646. Later, he returned to Béarn, where he succeeded his father as lay abbot of the Barétous valley. In 1650, he married Jeanne de Béarn-Bonasse, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. Although his death certificate is missing, scholars generally date his death between 1673 and 1675.

       Born in Pau and baptized there on February 2, 1617, Isaac de Portau’s family came from Audaux near Navarrenx. His father was a notable figure, a notary at the Estates of Béarn who gained nobility by purchasing seigneuries. A widower and father of a daughter, he remarried Anne d’Arrac de Gan, daughter of a Protestant pastor.

       Isaac joined the regiment of the French Guards as a cadet-gentleman in the Essarts company and remained until October 1642. Likely wounded in battle, he retired from active service in 1650. Subsequently, he became the ammunition keeper for the fortress of Navarrenx, a post granted by his brother Jean. The date of his death is unknown, but tradition associates him with a manor in Lanne-en-Barétous (also the homeland of the Aramitz family).

       Militarily, the musketeers’ golden age was under Louis XIV, especially in the late 17th century. The Wars of Devolution (1667-1668), Holland (1672-1678), and the Nine Years (1688-1697) offered them many opportunities to distinguish themselves in sieges and commando assaults. However, from 1701, with the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), the musketeers—originally light cavalry—were assigned to the army’s right wing alongside other royal household units.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Though effective in sieges and surprise attacks, they then fought mainly as heavy cavalry, often in French defeats such as Ramillies (1706), Malplaquet (1709) and Dettingen (1743). They continued to show courage and prestige, covering French retreats effectively; enemies dared not charge them head-on due to their fierce reputation. Their last notable action came at Fontenoy (1745), helping to destroy the British column.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In the 18th century the  musketeers became more of a royal political police force. From 1718 onwards  they acted as the King’s armed arm to compel the Parliament to obey, often delivering

       at night, sometimes violently. Under the Regency, Philippe d’Orléans used them for arrests, confirming a role assigned by Louis XIV in 1661 as jailers of state prisoners. These duties contributed to the musketeers’ dark legend: admired yet feared.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Criticism grew over the century. As they were increasingly sidelined from battlefields, detractors accused them of no longer justifying their elite status and their privileges, especially their financial privileges, which were deemed too costly. The death of Louis XV and the rise of Louis XVI, who pursued reforms and savings, led to their disbandment. The Count of Saint-Germain, who disliked military privileges, ordered their dismissal on December 15, 1775.

       Throughout the history of the Musketeers several officers bore the name d’Artagnan—or

       , as it was sometimes spelled at the time. Charles was born between 1610 and 1615 at the Château de Castelmore, the fourth of seven siblings.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       On 12 May 1565 Arnaud de Batz, a wealthy merchant living in Lupiac, Gascony, acquired the Château de Castelmore and the manor of La Plagne. He had two sons.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Bertrand inherited Castelmore, while Pierre received La Plagne. Bertrand had no legitimate heirs and chose as his successor his nephew Bertrand II, Pierre’s eldest son. Upon Bertrand’s death in late 1607 Bertrand II de Batz became Lord of Castelmore. This rise in landownership and social standing made him a suitable match for the future Charles’s mother.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Her name was Françoise de Montesquiou d’Artagnan, a member of the prestigious Montesquiou family—an ancient noble lineage, one branch of which held the lordship of Artagnan in Bigorre.

     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       <br/>
      </span>
      <span>
       The Montesquiou family counted many influential figures, including Henry de Montesquiou, who was responsible for organizing the royal marriage of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa of Spain, and Jean I de Montesquiou d’Artagnan, who served in the French Guards regiment.

       Paul was the eldest of seven children born to Bertrand II de Batz de Castelmore and Françoise de Montesquiou d’Artagnan. According to contemporary accounts, he was born in 1609 or 1610 and began his military career in the early 1630s.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       He first served in the Auterive Regiment before joining the Musketeers (his name appears in the records from 1637 and 1640). The king later promoted him to lieutenant in the French Guards. Paul took part in the defense of Piedmont and was seriously wounded while leading a charge during the Siege of Turin (1640). He had barely recovered when he was sent to Flanders. He likely left military service in 1646, when the Musketeers were disbanded, and sold his captain’s commission in the Guards Regiment.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Returning to Gascony he inherited the family estate, now dilapidated and in debt. Though retired from active military life, he continued to serve the Crown: first as governor of the Fort of Brégançon, then on 12 May 1667 as governor of the citadel of Navarrenx.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In 1702 the de Batz de Castelmore family was accused of « usurping noble titles. » On January 15 Paul was condemned by the intendant of the

       of Montauban. In response he appealed directly to Louis XIV, citing both his own service and that of his brother. He recalled his loyalty, the wound sustained at Turin and his lack of heirs, and pleaded for the king’s clemency.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Touched by Paul’s loyalty and long service, Louis XIV ordered the intendant to suspend all proceedings. Paul de Castelmore died two years later on 23 May 1704 at around 95 years of age—although the record of his death incorrectly showed his age as 101.

       Despite a demanding military career, d’Artagnan also led an active personal life. On March 5, 1659, at around forty years of age, he married Anne-Charlotte de Chanlecy, Lady of Sainte-Croix, a Burgundian noblewoman who brought a substantial dowry to the marriage.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Aware of her husband’s significant expenses at court, she took care to protect her personal fortune, as shown by specific clauses in their marriage contract. The union between d’Artagnan and Anne-Charlotte was far from harmonious. Madame d’Artagnan appears in archival records as a determined, independent woman, strongly attached to defending her rights. Tireless in litigation, she frequently appeared in court accompanied by her lawyer, especially in Mâcon.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Given their strong personalities, marital tensions led to a legal separation of property in 1665. Shortly after, likely wearied by his wife’s character, d’Artagnan requested and obtained from the King a

      <i>

       that forced her to remain on her Burgundian estates. It was only after d’Artagnan’s death that Anne-Charlotte returned to Paris to settle her husband’s estate.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The couple had two sons, both named Louis de Batz de Castelmore (1660-1709 and 1661-1714), named in honour of the King. Their late baptisms in 1674 at Versailles were significant events: the King and Queen served as godparents to the eldest, while the Grand Dauphin and Mademoiselle de Montpensier were sponsors to the younger. This double patronage reflected the official esteem the monarchy held for d’Artagnan, even posthumously.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The King personally covered the costs of their education, providing a tutor for their general instruction and a valet to assist them daily.

       The Musketeers were among the first men in the French army to wear a uniform. Previously, soldiers distinguished themselves on the battlefield by painting a white cross or wearing a white scarf—the color of France—over their own clothing.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In 1622 the Musketeers received a blue cassock adorned with white fleur-de-lis crosses as their official uniform, worn over their personal clothes. The colour and crosses symbolized the King’s arms and authority. More than anything, this first uniform resembled a domestic livery, given that the Musketeers served the sovereign as guards, much like his valets. For this reason, it took more than a century for uniforms to become widespread in the French armies, as colonels refused to adopt attire that implied a domestic status.

       The short cassock issued to the Musketeers was initially a simple four-flap coat, designed to protect the rider from rain. It ended at the waist but was lengthened around 1668 to reach the Musketeers’ knees. This change was introduced as a result of a shift in boot fashion, as the high, knee-length boots favored by Louis XIII gave way under Louis XIV to wider, lower boots cut below the knee, which meant that water that once ran off the cassock onto the boots now trickled into the boots themselves. However, this longer cassock proved cumbersome in battle, so musketeers often removed it so as to be able to  charge more swiftly, despite the fact that without the cassock it was harder for enemies to identify them.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Around 1688 Louis XIV ordered the cassock to be replaced by a garment designed specially for the musketeers. The Musketeers wore this

      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In the 1670s the King also mandated the wearing of a uniform beneath the cassock: for the musketeers, this was the red

       Following the advice of engineers such as Vauban, Louis XIV favored siege warfare over pitched battles and mobile warfare. According to Vauban sieges were more controlled than battles, whose outcome often depended in no small measure on chance. War thus came to be viewed increasingly as a question of arithmetic, and Vauban was accordingly able to develop precisely calculated methods for capturing fortified places.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Sieges resembled chess games in which, by gradually capturing fortifications by means of day-by-day assaults, the goal was to increase pressure on the besieged forces until they surrendered. Vauban believed that no city was truly impregnable; what mattered was time. If a siege lasted too long, relief armies could be summoned to break it.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Vauban devised techniques to hasten capture for attackers and to prolong resistance for defenders. Defenders aimed to avoid storming assaults, which usually meant the loss of all bargaining power. However, the growing number of fortifications outside city walls during the 17th century made assaults increasingly difficult to organise. Despite this, the musketeers were successful in storming Valenciennes in 1677, much to everyone’s surprise.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Under Louis XIV musketeers became masters of city assaults and, although he disliked their reckless boldness, Vauban regularly used them for this purpose. Typically, a city surrendered the very day, or even hour, that followed  a musketeer-led charge. Assaults during sieges were often led by small groups of a few hundred men attacking specific fortifications, a manoeuvre in which musketeers excelled here by virtue of their small numbers and their exceptional zeal.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The assault force usually consisted of three groups: at the center were placed grenadiers, elite soldiers chosen for their strength and experience; on the left, a detachment of the second musketeer company; and on the right, in the place of honour, a detachment of the first company. Musketeers covered the grenadiers as they crossed the glacis (an artificial defensive slope) under enemy fire to reach the fortress walls, throwing five-kilo bombs to clear the way. The musketeers then climbed the broken walls and attacked the defenders with swords drawn.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The fighting was often bloody: at Lille in 1667, for example, sixty  musketeers led by d’Artagnan killed two hundred Spanish soldiers in under ten minutes.

       Born in Saint-Léger-de-Foucheret in Burgundy, Vauban joined the French army in 1651. He began his military career as a young soldier and quickly distinguished himself through his expertise in fortification and siege techniques. He participated in numerous campaigns in which he mastered the art of war, especially the siege and defense of fortresses. Vauban served in many military campaigns under Louis XIV, including the Dutch War and the War of the Spanish Succession. He took part in the capture of several cities and fortresses, including Maastricht and Luxembourg, and was appointed Chief Engineer of the Kingdom in 1678.
      </span>
     </p>

      <span>
       Vauban is best known for his innovations in fortification. He developed a system that strengthened fortresses while making their defense easier against enemy attacks.

       Alexandre Dumas was born on July 24, 1802, in Villers-Cotterêts. His father, Thomas Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie, was a former slave who became a republican general before being dismissed by Napoleon Bonaparte. His mother, Marie-Louise-Elisabeth Labouret, was the daughter of an innkeeper in Villers-Cotterêts.

       Dumas lost his father at the age of four and was raised by his mother. Educated at the college of Abbé Grégoire, Alexandre spent more time honing his skills with weapons and hunting than attending classes. His literary education was largely self-taught, shaped by his reading. At the age of fourteen he was hired as a courier by a notary and he later became a notary clerk.

       Dumas arrived in Paris in 1822 with only 53 francs to his name. Through former comrades-in-arms of his father, he obtained a position in the secretariat of the Duke of Orléans. Meanwhile, he continued writing and met literary figures in the salons of the time. Recognizing his literary shortcomings, he pursued a second, self-directed education, devouring books day and night.

       His early attempts as an author were difficult: journals rejected his poems, and theatre directors barely glanced at the plays he co-wrote with Adolphe. The two friends eventually partnered with Pierre-Joseph Rousseau, who was better connected in theatrical circles, and together they wrote the vaudeville

       Queen of France, wife of Louis XIII and mother of Louis XIV, Anne of Austria was born in 1601 in Vienna, the daughter of Emperor Ferdinand II and Maria of Austria. She belonged to the House of Habsburg, one of the most influential dynasties in Europe, making her birth significant in the political alliances of the time.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Anne married Louis XIII in 1615, a union arranged as part of a diplomatic strategy to strengthen the alliance between France and the Habsburg Empire. Their marriage was famously difficult on a personal level; they lived apart for long periods and the King showed little interest in his Queen.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       An opponent of Cardinal Richelieu, Anne was suspected by him of playing a double game with Spain, France’s enemy. Richelieu uncovered secret correspondence between the Queen and her brother, King Philip IV of Spain, which served as a channel for leaking information. Forced by Louis XIII, the Queen signed confessions. Her name was implicated in several plots against the cardinal, including the famous Saint-Mars conspiracy.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Nevertheless, Anne overcame these challenges and became a key figure of power in France, especially after the death of her husband in 1643. Widowed, she became regent for their young son, Louis XIV, when he was only five years old. Her regency was marked by major political upheavals, notably the series of revolts by the nobility and by the Parlement against royal authorityknown as Fronde. With the help of her chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin, Anne navigated these crises, preserved the unity of the kingdom and strengthened her son’s position on the throne. She wielded considerable power, though it was Louis XIV who, after Mazarin’s death in 1661, assumed full control of the kingdom.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Anne of Austria died in 1666. Her regency and role as the mother of the Sun King are widely praised for their effectiveness and pragmatism, even if she often remained overshadowed by her son, whose reign would shape the history of France for decades to come.

       From the very first pages of the novel Dumas sketches a precise portrait of d’Artagnan, an 18-year-old Don Quixote with an angular face. In early illustrated editions, however, the hero’s features are softened and given grace and flair—images that were to be successfully brought to the screen.

     <p>
      <span>
       In the early days of cinema Maurice Leloir’s drawings greatly influenced the casting of d’Artagnan. In 1912, in Henri Pouctal and André Calmettes’s film, Émile Dehelly, the eternal young lead of the Comédie-Française, played the hero. In 1921 Henri Diamant-Berger cast Aimé Simon-Girard, then thirty-two years old and with a youthful face and agile silhouette that suited Leloir’s ideal perfectly.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       That same year Douglas Fairbanks played d’Artagnan in the American version. Although close to forty years old, he still had a youthful appearance and a fit body, performing all his own stunts. Both films were highly successful and set a precedent for d’Artagnan’s cinematic portrayal: a genuine athlete capable of stunts and with a vigorous look.

       The year 1948 marked the release of George Sidney’s adaptation starring Gene Kelly. Kelly showcased all the qualities of d’Artagnan’s success: athletic skill, elegance and eternal youthfulness. He modeled his performance on Douglas Fairbanks, and fast-paced sequences are a central feature of the film.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In André Hunebelle’s 1953 version, well-known stars of the time played the roles; Georges Marchal portrayed d’Artagnan, while Bourvil played Planchet. Marchal became recognized as the reference for the athletic interpretation.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       During the 1950s, d’Artagnan was mainly played by stars whose reputations were already established.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In 1961 Bernard Borderie’s two films aimed to remain as faithful as possible to Dumas’ novel, again starring prominent actors, with Gérard Barray—a specialist in swashbuckler films—playing the physical role of d’Artagnan.

       In 2011 Paul W.S. Anderson’s fantasy version followed the tradition: Logan Lerman, who played d’Artagnan, was 29 and underwent intensive fencing training. The two latest films by Martin Bourboulon confirm the trend, with François Civil portraying d’Artagnan.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>

       Cinema has reshaped the character’s image for modern audiences. D’Artagnan is now athletic, much older than eighteen, and embodies the contemporary ideals of masculine beauty.

       Antoine III de Gramont descended from an ancient noble family of Béarn. He was the son of Antoine II, the first Duke of Gramont, and of Louise de Roquelaure. Through his mother he was the grandson of Marshal Antoine de Roquelaure, the owner and builder of the Château de Lavardens in the 17th century. In 1634 he married a niece of Cardinal Richelieu, with whom he had four children. His daughter Catherine Charlotte married Louis Grimaldi, becoming Princess of Monaco.

     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       A man of war Antoine III campaigned against the Huguenots under Richelieu. Demonstrating unwavering loyalty to King Louis XIV and Queen Anne of Austria during the Fronde, he was promoted to Marshal of France in 1641. He held numerous important posts: Lieutenant General of Normandy, Viceroy of Navarre and Béarn (1644), Duke and Peer of France (1648), Minister of State (1653) and Colonel of the French Guards (1661). As ambassador to Madrid he arranged the marriage of Louis XIV and was entrusted with full powers to represent the King at the ceremony held in the Spanish capital. He also welcomed Louis XIV, Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin upon their arrival in Bayonne.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       A friend of the Montesquiou d’Artagnan family, he took the young Charles de Batz de Castelmore under his protection during his early days at court. He intervened several times with Queen Anne and Cardinal Mazarin to secure a position for his protégé in the French Guards regiment. Unlike many of his military peers Antoine III was a cultured man who regularly attended literary salons.

       With this new shock corps taking on the most dangerous assignments, the Musketeers adopted a more educational role, training young aristocrats.

The Musketeers remained active through the 18th century and the reign of Louis XV until their sudden disbandment in 1775 as part of the military reforms initiated by the Count of Saint-Germain, Minister of War under the early reign of Louis XVI.

       Castelmore, the château where d’Artagnan was born, was never a luxurious residence, and Bertrand de Batz, although of minor nobility, was a man of only modest means who left behind him a heavily indebted estate at his death.
      </span>
     </p>

      <span>
       His widow, Françoise de Montesquiou, was forced to pawn all her belongings. Gascony too, at the time, was going through a difficult financial period, with high taxes, outbreaks of plague, drought and frequent hailstorms, while armed conflicts were further destabilizing the countryside.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       It is thus easy to understand why the children of Castelmore—first Paul, then Charles and Jean—chose to leave their ancestral home.

     </p>

      <span>
       We know little about d’Artagnan’s early years. Like other Gascon cadets, he most likely learned French—Gascon being his native language—along with arithmetic and a bit of Latin. At the same time, he would have been trained in fencing and horseback riding. Like their uncle Daniel, his younger brother Arnaud became a theologian and parish priest in Lupiac. while their sister Jeanne, the youngest, was sent to the Ursuline convent in Auch.

       At the age of sixteen or seventeen cadets tended to leave home for Paris in search of fortune and glory,and ever since the time of Henri IV many young men from Gascony and Béarn had followed this path. Their future remained uncertain however; many remained simple soldiers, some fell into poverty, while others wandered the streets in search of employment—or a duel.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Upon arrival in Paris, cadets underwent one or two years of military training, financed by their regiment but without pay. This training opened several paths: the most deserving could become non-commissioned officers, while those with sufficient means could purchase a commission as officers. Some, rewarded for their bravery, were granted posts directly by the King.

       Bound by family and political bonds, Musketeers were often unruly figures at court and in Paris. Though generally drawn from the high nobility, they were often very young and on frequent occasions engaged in disorderly conduct, sparking clashes with law enforcement that  sometimes resulted in fatalities or arrests.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Dueling was a common practice among Musketeers and could end fatally. Armand de Sillègue d’Athos d’Autevielle, for example, was found dead on 21 December 1643 at the

      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Despite their reputation as unruly swordsmen, Musketeers played a key role in maintaining public order. At a time when no police force existed, authorities often relied on the army to suppress civil unrest, popular uprisings or revolts among the nobles—particularly during the

       (1648–1652).
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Thus, Musketeers were at one and the same time feared duelists and instruments of royal repression, wielding the sword for honour and the musket to enforce the King’s authority. Yet they were also known to provoke fights, especially under the influence of alcohol.

       The Musketeers’ legendary reputation was partly shaped by the many duels they fought, adding to their mystique. Depicting their rivalry with Cardinal Richelieu’s guards, Alexandre Dumas vividly captures this tradition in his works. This tension reflected a real conflict between two factions—one in which the King, far from acting as an impartial sovereign, often behaved more like a clan leader.

       From 1622 onward the Musketeers were quartered in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, lodged in the homes of residents who were obliged to host these boisterous young soldiers. In 1659 Louis XIV decided to build them a proper barracks on the

     <p>

       Designed to house 150 men, the complex included accommodations, stables and various services such as a chapel, a forge and a bakery. However, as the King began favoring Saint-Germain-en-Laye and later Versailles, and as most troops were mobilized outside the capital during military campaigns, the Musketeers’ presence in Paris became less essential.

       Born into a noble family, Armand Jean du Plessis initially prepared for a military career before entering the Church to take up the bishopric of Luçon. His keen intellect and political acumen allowed him to rise quickly through the ranks of power.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       He first served Queen Mother Marie de’ Medici and then gained the trust of King Louis XIII, who appointed him as his chief minister in 1624. Richelieu’s mission was clear: to strengthen royal authority and weaken all powers that could challenge it.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       He targeted the Protestants by besieging La Rochelle (1627–1628) and stripping them of their political privileges. He also repressed the high nobility with severity when it conspired against the crown. On the international stage, he pursued an ambitious policy to counter the power of the Habsburgs. Under his leadership the French army became a formidable force.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Richelieu made many enemies, particularly among the nobility, who resented his authority. He faced several plots and assassination attempts. King Louis XIII provided him with close protection, initially through a small cavalry unit, later expanded into a full personal guard. As early as 1631 Richelieu obtained the creation of military companies dedicated to his security. His personal guard, which at first consisted of a company of light horsemen, was replaced in 1633 by a foot regiment of Musketeers, recognizable by their red tabards marked with a white cross, who ensured his protection.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       At the same time Richelieu built up a full military household, with several regiments actively engaged on battlefields, particularly during the Thirty Years’ War. This personal military force aroused suspicion, since maintaining a private guard was considered a royal privilege. Some consequently viewed Richelieu as a rival to the King, and pamphleteers and other critics painted him as a usurper surrounded by henchmen rather than by legitimate soldiers.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Richelieu also modernized the state administration, strengthening the role of the

       ) in 1635. Worn down by illness he died in 1642, leaving behind a more centralized and powerful France. His political legacy was carried on by Cardinal Mazarin and culminated in the absolutism of Louis XIV.

      </span>

     <p>
      <span>
       In Dumas’ world Richelieu is the archetype of the ruthless man of power, inspired both by 17th-century memoirists and the 19th-century Romantic imagination. He is portrayed as manipulating Louis XIII and orchestrating Buckingham’s assassination. Yet beyond the clichés, Dumas also presents a brilliant strategist—always well-informed, always one step ahead.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Dumas rarely depicts him in cardinal’s robes, instead dressing him as a man of action, sometimes in military uniform or Spanish riding gear. His political pragmatism and sense of timing are highlighted as he seizes on others’ weaknesses and turns former enemies into allies, including d’Artagnan. In

       George Villiers, favorite of King James I of England, was one of the most influential political figures at the English court in the early 17th century. Born in 1592 to a modest family in Leicestershire, he caught the King’s attention through his charm and elegance. Supported by powerful courtiers he rose quickly through the ranks, becoming a knight in 1615 and Duke of Buckingham in 1623.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Under King James I he accumulated numerous titles and wielded considerable power over the kingdom’s politics. After James’s death in 1625 he maintained his influence under Charles I, becoming his chief advisor. He played a central role in diplomacy and military affairs, notably involving himself in wars against Spain and France.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       However, his ambition and authoritarian style earned him many enemies both in Parliament and the army. His disastrous expedition to the Isle of Ré in 1627, aimed at supporting French Protestant rebels in La Rochelle against Richelieu, further damaged his reputation. Ultimately, in 1628, he was assassinated in Portsmouth by John Felton, an officer frustrated by Buckingham’s military failures.

       Gatien de Courtilz, Sieur de Sandras and du Verger, came from an old aristocratic family. Around 1660, he began a military career by joining the Musketeers: “First a Musketeer, then a cornet in the Royal-Etranger, then captain in the Beaupré-Choiseul regiment, from which he was dismissed after the Treaty of Nijmegen…” (Bibliothèque de l’Arsenal, Bastille Archives, file 10 497).

     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Although he is mentioned as a Musketeer here, his name does not appear in the official rosters of the company. He left military service in 1678 following the Treaty of Nijmegen and, without personal fortune, turned to writing for a living.

       Criticizing the King and the government in the 17th century was dangerous, and Courtilz de Sandras quickly learned this lesson as he was imprisoned in the Bastille from April 1693 to March 1699.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       According to some sources, it was during this first imprisonment that Courtilz conceived the idea and gathered information to write

      <span>
       . At the time, the Bastille governor was François de Monlezun, Seigneur de Besmaux, a longtime friend of d’Artagnan, and it is possible that Courtilz received confidences about d’Artagnan from Besmaux during his imprisonment. However, Courtilz’s writings suggest a strained relationship between the two men, with Courtilz accusing Besmaux of enriching himself at prisoners’ expense.

       Some have speculated that Courtilz, as a Musketeer himself, might have served under or been close to d’Artagnan. In point of fact, however, Courtilz probably served in the second Musketeer company under Colbert de Vandières, not in d’Artagnan’s first company.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       So where did his sources come from? Courtilz claimed to have gathered various documents from d’Artagnan’s personal papers and simply connected them. This claim is dubious, however, as the historical d’Artagnan was not a prolific writer, he made many spelling mistakes and his surviving writings are mostly in the form of official letters.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       It is likely that much of what Courtilz recounts about d’Artagnan is in fact fictional, woven into a framework of true events. While some details are accurate, Courtilz mixes up dates, people and events, and his use of history is essentially as a backdrop for political intrigues, espionage, escapes, and duels—techniques designed to entertain readers.

       In the spring of 1670 a major revolt broke out in Aubenas, in the Vivarais region, where many peasants rose up against new taxes. The uprising was fueled by false rumours about additional levies. The peasants rallied behind a minor nobleman, Antoine de Roure, whom they chose as their leader. Acts of violence increased and the unrest became political, with the peasants demanding the expulsion of royal officers whom they blamed for the oppressive taxes.

       Initially the government close not to respond, thereby allowing the movement to spread across the region. Eventually, in June, a military expedition was organized under General Le Bret and cavalry commander d’Artagnan, while a detachment of the King’s two Mousquetaire companies were ordered to join the force.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The deployment of the Mousquetaires was highly symbolic. The royal army numbered six thousand professional soldiers against two thousand peasants, and the King’s response was mainly a show of force meant to intimidate. The final clash took place on July 25 at Lavilledieu, where the peasants were brutally crushed by the Mousquetaires and other soldiers. A harsh repression followed throughout the region, though d’Artagnan left with his men on August 10 and did not participate in the confiscations or summary executions ordered by the harsh Marshal Le Bret. According to some accounts, d’Artagnan refused to take part in the looting, often accompanied by murder and rape, and ordered his men to do the same.

       : “They killed as many as they wanted.” In reality, the Mousquetaires did what they did best: fight as warriors. The revolt was swiftly ended, while Roure fled, hid for several months and was eventually arrested in October and sentenced to death in Montpellier.

       Jean-Armand du Peyrer, the son of Marie d’Aramits and Jean du Peyrer, owner of the Trois-Villes estate in the Basque valley of Soule since 1607, moved to Paris in 1616 to join the French Guards. He was present at the 1627 siege of La Rochelle, where he was wounded while serving with the Musketeers.

       He became captain-lieutenant of the Musketeers’ company in 1634, during the outbreak of the Cinq-Mars affair. The Marquis of Cinq-Mars, initially favored by Louis XIII through Richelieu’s influence, turned against the cardinal and plotted against him. Tréville was approached but difficult to persuade. His loyalty remained with the King, who favored the marquis but distrusted the cardinal. Richelieu uncovered the plot and executed Cinq-Mars, despite his status as the King’s favorite. With no solid proof against Tréville, Richelieu could not tolerate him as an opponent and demanded his immediate exile.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       After Richelieu’s death in 1642 the King recalled Tréville and restored his command of the Musketeers. The same year, Louis XIII died. Anne of Austria elevated Trois-Villes to a county in honour of her husband’s loyal servant.

       The relationship between the new prime minister Mazarin and Tréville was no better. Suspicious of Tréville’s possible involvement in the Cinq-Mars conspiracy, Mazarin dissolved the Musketeers’ company in 1646 under the pretext of saving money. Tréville retired to his estates but was still appointed governor of the Foix region. He died in 1672 at the Château d’Eliçabéa, which he had built at Trois-Villes.

       Our story begins in the heart of Gascony, in the Gers region of southwestern France—land nestled between the Pyrenees and the Garonne Valley, bordered by the Landes and the Toulouse area. This is the birthplace of d’Artagnan, and a region long known as the cradle of soldiers—some of whom would become generals and marshals. They were famously known as the “Cadets of Gascony.”

       Far from their native Gascony, these fiery young soldiers often found themselves at the center of duels—strictly forbidden at the time. In Paris, they formed a close-knit brotherhood built on loyalty and mutual support. This spirit of solidarity was encouraged by successive monarchs—Henri IV, Louis XIII, and Louis XIV—who sought fiercely loyal men at their side. Alexandre Dumas drew inspiration from this mindset to create the legendary motto of the Musketeers:
      </span>

   <div>
    <div>
     <p>
      <span>
       Though largely forgotten by history, Antoine de Roquelaure was one of the most important military and political figures in 17th-century France. Owner of the Château de Lavardens, he initiated its reconstruction beginning in 1608.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Born into an old noble family dating back to the 12th century, Roquelaure was the third son and as such he was initially destined for the Church. He abandoned this path to pursue a military career, entering the service of Queen Jeanne of Navarre.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       At the age of eighteen he became a close companion of the future King Henri IV, who recognized his sharp mind and unwavering loyalty. Roquelaure quickly proved himself on the battlefield and, through his proximity to the king, played a key role in mediating with factions of the Catholic League in the war against Protestantism.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In recognition of his services, he was granted numerous titles and offices: Master of the Royal Wardrobe, Knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit, Captain of Fontainebleau and Mayor of Bordeaux, among others. In 1613, while retaining his position as governor of Lectoure, he began to withdraw from public life and devoted himself to improving his estates.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Roquelaure’s destiny is closely tied to the major events of his time. He was in the carriage with Henri IV when the king was assassinated by Ravaillac in May 1610. During the regency of Marie de’ Medici, he was called upon to restore order in rebellious cities. In 1614 Louis XIII appointed him Marshal of France. Among his children, Gaston-Jean-Baptiste would become the first Duke of Roquelaure and a Peer of France.

    <div>
     <p>
      <span>
       Born into a military family, Jean-Louis de Nogaret de La Valette was one of the most powerful royal favorites of his time. Ambitious and politically astute from a young age, he remained a close friend of Antoine de Roquelaure throughout his life.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       During the Wars of Religion, he took part in the first siege of La Rochelle (1572–1573), where he caught the attention of King Henri III and quickly rose in royal favour. He amassed numerous high-ranking titles, including Colonel General of the French Infantry, Duke and Peer of France.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       In 1589 he pledged loyalty to Henri of Navarre, the future Henri IV. However, his allegiance remained ambiguous—though outwardly loyal, he retained close ties to Catholic and League circles, complicating his relationship with the new king.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Despite his age he was wounded in battle in 1621, demonstrating his continued military commitment. When Louis XIII created the company of the Musketeers on horseback in 1622, he personally requested that Épernon provide six of his guards to form the core of this elite unit.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       As Cardinal Richelieu’s power rose Épernon’s influence waned. Opposed to the centralization of royal authority and the cardinal’s reforms, he grew increasingly isolated. His political authority was gradually undermined, and he was eventually forced to withdraw from public life. He died in 1642, one of the last great favorites of a fading era in which powerful dukes still rivaled royal authority.

       When Charles de Batz arrived in Paris in the early 1630s, only one company of Musketeers existed. His name appears in 1633 on a military roll reviewed by Louis XIII, confirming his presence in the company then commanded by Jean de Vieilchastel. The following year, command passed to Jean Armand du Peyré, lord of Troisvilles (or Tréville).

       In the absence of relevant archives, the exact length of his service in the Musketeers remains uncertain. His name disappears from surviving rolls in 1637 and 1640, although that of his elder brother, Paul de Castelmore, still appears. It is highly likely that both brothers took part in the main campaigns waged by France under Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu.

      <span>
       In 1622, during the wars against the Huguenots, Louis XIII transformed a unit of light cavalry into an elite corps: the King’s Musketeers. Initially armed with muskets, which they could only use on foot, they retained the aristocratic culture of mounted warfare. Their missions were diverse: combat, policing, and protecting the sovereign.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       The Musketeers were part of the King’s Military Household, the foundation of the standing army. Under the King direct authority, to whom they owed absolute loyalty, they remained beyond the influence of powerful nobles. Louis XIV, fully aware of their strategic value, reorganized the corps in 1663 and 1664, creating two companies named after the colour of their horses: the Greys and the Blacks.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span>
       Musketeers embodied the ideals of noble warriors—bravery, boldness and loyalty. They were often at the forefront of assaults and sieges. During the Dutch War they gained renown for their involvement in the most intense operations. Their mottos—
